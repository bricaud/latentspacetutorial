# Latent Space Exploration

A simple exploration of the latent space of deep neural networks. Include models train on texts and models train on images.

The notebooks show how to extract some embeddings from the models (Huggingface models) and visualize the embeddings in 2D using PCA, t-SNE and UMAP.

Bonus: A python file where a sparse autoencoder is implemented and tested on a simple neural net trained on MNIST.
